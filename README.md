## Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can play against another player, take turns, and restart the game when it's over. It's a great project to practice basic game logic and DOM manipulation.

### Features:
- Interactive game board with clickable cells
- Real-time turn tracking and winner announcement
- Restart functionality to play multiple rounds

### How to Play:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Start playing by clicking on the cells in the grid!

### Future Enhancements:
- Adding an AI opponent to play against.
- Implementing score tracking across multiple games.
- Making the game mobile-responsive.

Feel free to fork the project and contribute!
